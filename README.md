# DSA
Author - Soumavo Mondal

This is collection of DSA Questions segregated into various DSA Patterns.
This is made keeping in mind, the ease of revision during interview preparation.
Each pattern and question will have its own README.md file which is a note for that particular pattern or question.
This is intended to help jog our memory in relation to the particular pattern or question.
